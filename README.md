# Style Guidelines

These are the Coding Guidelines for Frontend Developers at Netwerven. These guidelines are a summary of different guidelines and best-practices from all over the web, best matching with Ways of Workin (WoW) within Netwerven. Although these guidelines should not change too often, there may be new insights and/or new syntaxes to work with, that need there own guidelines. Also, these guidelines may be updated

## Key principles
Whatever syntax you choose and whatever approach you prefer when styling a frontend-application; at all times:

*KISS (Keep.It.Simple.Stupid)<br />
& <br />
DRY (Don’t.Repeat.Yourself)*

However, all that follows are guidelines, not rigid rules. Sometimes pragmatism, might be favoured over guidelines. One of these is the use of a “shame”-module. It might not be the “cleanest” or “best” answer to a problem, but it might be a pragmatic answer at a certain point of time.
